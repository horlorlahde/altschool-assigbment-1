            <p>
                My name is Shopade Abdulazeez. I hail from Lagos State, Nigeria. I am an aspiring software engineer currently pursuing
                my diploma on the ALT School Backend Engineering track. I am someone who is passionate about technology and its
                advancements, as well as fascinated by the capability of being able to build something with ripple effects, helping
                more people solve a particular problem made possible by the advancement of technology.

            <h3>WHY AltSchool Africa:</h3>
            <p>
                Growing up, I've always been fascinated by the capabilities of technology without even knowing it was called 'tech.'
                When I started this program, I knew nothing about the tech industry because I was a total newbie. I chose ALT School
                over others because my interest isn't just to become a successful software engineer, but also to have a smooth
                onboarding into the tech industry at large. I identified ALT School as the perfect vehicle to put me in that
                direction. It's been over a month into this program, and I believe I made the right decision in choosing ALT School.

            <h3>My Goals and Aspirations:</h3>
            <p>
                As I navigate through this program, I anticipate a transformative journey. At the program's conclusion, my
                aspiration is to be well-equipped and prepared for the dynamic and competitive job market. I hope to secure a
                well-paying position in the tech industry, one that not only sustains me financially but also challenges and
                fulfills me intellectually. The journey isn't just about technical proficiency but about gaining a deeper
                understanding of the industry's intricacies, trends, and the larger technological landscape. I aim to be not just a
                participant but a contributor to this ever-evolving field.

                It's important to acknowledge my starting point: a total newbie. But it's precisely this "blank slate" status that
                excites me. I wish to measure my growth, not only in terms of knowledge and skills but in the personal growth that
                comes from venturing into unfamiliar territories, tackling challenges, and broadening my horizons.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Overall, the path ahead is uncertain, and there's a sense of anticipation for the adventure that lies ahead. While I
                may not have all the answers, I'm excited to see what the world has in store for me. I firmly believe that this
                program is a stepping stone towards a future filled with possibilities, and I'm ready to embrace the wonderful
                adventure that awaits.
